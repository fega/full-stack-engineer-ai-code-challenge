This interview is recorded. Before you begin, you must:

  1. Open PRIVACY_RELEASE.md in this repo.
  2. Read it carefully — it covers what is recorded during the session
     and our privacy commitment to you.
  3. Fill in your name in the "## Signed" section.
  4. Fill in today's date in the "## Date" section.
  5. Re-run ./start.sh.

If you do not consent to the recording, do not sign — and let the
interviewer know.
